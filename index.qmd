## Introduction to Mathematics and Logic

#### Lemma: if $x^2$ is even then $x$ is even.

Proof: Proof by contrapositive

We will prove that if $x$ is odd then $x^2$ is odd.

By definition of an odd number, $x=2k+1$.

Therefore,

$x^2=(2k+1)^2$

$x^2=4k^2+4k+1$

$x^2=2(2k^2+2k)+1$

Therefore $x^2$ is odd.

### Square root of 2 is not a rational number

We call a number rational if it can be written as $\frac{m}{n}$ and m,n are integers.

Assume for contradiction that $\sqrt{2}=\frac{m}{n}$, and m is not divisible by n.

$\sqrt{2}=\frac{m}{n}$

$2=\frac{m^2}{n^2}$

$2*n^2=m^2$

Therefore, $m^2$ is even.

By our Lemma, m is even.

$2*n^2=m^2$

$2*n^2=m*m$

$2*n^2=(2k)(2k)$

$2*n^2=4k^2$

$n^2=2k^2$

Therefore, n is even and they have a common factor.

Therefore, there is a contradiction, and $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.
